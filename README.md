# Zomato Global Restaurant Analysis 📊🍽️

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a global dataset of 9,500+ restaurants to identify high-potential markets for expansion. I used **Advanced Excel** to transform raw, inconsistent data into actionable business insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Data Cleaning:** Cleaned 9,000+ rows of data, handled missing values, and corrected city name inconsistencies.
- **Advanced Formulas:** Used `VLOOKUP` for currency conversion and `IF` statements for data categorization.
- **Pivot Tables:** Built 10+ pivot tables to analyze ratings vs. price ranges and cuisine popularity.
- **Strategic Visualization:** Developed a dashboard using Pivot Charts to highlight market gaps.

## 📈 Key Business Insights
- **Target Markets:** Identified Indonesia, Philippines, and Qatar as top expansion targets due to high customer ratings and low-to-moderate competition.
- **Service Impact:** Verified that restaurants offering **Table Bookings** and **Online Delivery** maintain 15% higher average ratings.
- **Pricing Strategy:** Discovered that 79% of the global market is driven by affordability (Price Range 1 & 2).
